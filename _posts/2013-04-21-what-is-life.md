Now I'm sitting in front of my computer, thinking what can I do after I graduate from college.

I often think there's nothing I can't achieve for I am so optimistic and positive,but this moment I think it's myself that makes me feel depressed.

Will I be a successful person after four or five years?

I have my dream, yes, and I never forget it. I keep my promise that I must succeed, sometimes, however, I feel confused how should I achieve my big dream, or I can call it small dream?

As the saying goes:"Life was like a box of chocolates, you never get to know what the next will be. " It absolutely is right, life is tough, but I want to ask " Compared to what? " Maybe life itself is simple, it is we that think it is complex. Like half water theory, optimistic man will feel lucky when they are very thirsty, but pessimistic man won't, they will complain that there is only half.

It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all—in which case, you fail by default.

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way.  I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above rubies.

The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that / you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by ad'versity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more to me / than any qualification I ever earned.

Given a time machine or a Time Turner, I would tell my 21-year-old self / that personal happiness lies in knowing that / life is not a check-list of acquisition or achievement. Your qualifications, your CV, are not your life, though you will meet many people of my age and older / who confuse the two. Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone's total control, and the humility to know that / will enable you to survive its vicissitudes.

I was sitting outside my new home yesterday (we just moved last week, and we love the new place), watching the world go by.

There were people in cars, in a hurry to get to their next appointment. There were birds flying by, insects just as busy as the people in cars, plants and weeds thriving in the 'humid Guam climate.

Inside the house, my children were also busy, as ever, making a mess of the house (which my wife and I would soon clean up), getting into things, their natural curiosity overpowering our previous pleas for them not to play with lotion or take things apart.

The sky was slightly overcast and there was a cool breeze, quite strong and pleasant actually.

It’s not often that most of us just sit quietly, and allow the world to pass us by.

Why not?

What is so important that it can’t wait until later? What email must be answered right this moment? Do we really need to read all those articles online, all those messages from others, all those newspapers and magazines? Do we need to have the television and radio and Internet on all the time?

Is life passing us by as we keep our minds super-busy? Are we missing out on the beautiful world around us as we constantly think about the future — what we need to do, our an'xieties about what might happen — and the past — what we did wrong, what someone else did to us, what we said, what should have happened?

When was the last time you just sat, and observed? Why not do it today?
